						Audience

					</h2>

					<p>

						I first divided the Audience into “Buys Baked Goods” and then “Refugees”. As I did this, I brainstormed different people/groups that I thought would be involved in these two groups based off of my research. Because of this, I decided “Buys Baked Goods” can encompass donors, volunteers, and fans of the company. Then, I broke them down into even more specific audiences that I thought would buy the baked goods.
						<br></br>
						<span class="image left"><img src="images/audiencerefined.jpg"alt="" /></span>
						These specific audiences had to have a love for baked goods but also a love for a good cause. Based off of my primary research, I was able to discover different audiences that Just Bakery of Atlanta reaches. I then was able to even break this further down so I could understand these people/groups even better. Overall, their audience is broad because baked goods and a good cause can reach a lot of people, but families and people/groups related to organizations were prominent in the audience breakdown.

						<br></br>
						Also, after talking with Leah Lonsbury, the director of Just Bakery, I now know that the reason why the audience can be so broad is because their audience can encompass anyone who wants to support a good cause which ends up being a diverse group of people.

					<h2>
						Site Goals
					</h2>
					<p>
						The Just Bakery of Atlanta website exists to share their purpose mainly. In order for the website to be impactful, the redesigned site needs to make their mission clear, their events easier to find, consistent branding, and overall make it easier to navigate. Users tend to be on the website when they have a desire to help the refugee crisis in Atlanta, to support a good cause in general, or to buy baked goods. They could do this in their home on their computer or when they are out and about and are at an event.
